# You seem to have reached the end of this hall.
# 
# After checking out the things in this room, you may
# need to turn back and try another path.
#
# Remember, to back track one directory, you type:
#
# cd ..
#
# You can also return to the entrance using an absolute path.
#
# If you are drawing a map of your progress,
# you can always get the name of your working
# directory with this command:
# 
# pwd
